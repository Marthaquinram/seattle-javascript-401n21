# Class 17 - S3 and Lambdas

## Review

### EC2

Virtual Machine - where we can setup an environment of our choosing

### Elastic Beanstalk

opinionated service that allows us to deploy and manage our application

### Lambda

specifically, what is it?  Lambda is a function.

what is this symbol:  `=>` Arrow, Fat Arrow, denotes an arrow function... also quite literally is referred as a lambda


### S3 (Simple Storage Service)

stores our data - long term storage solution

Its a bucket.   "a place to put things"

Object Storage.  files. images, videos, text files, variables
Data Storage:  

Databases are great for "scalar" values
- strings
- numbers
- objects with params
- booleans

s3:
images / videos / text files
also have some of those scalar items too...  maybe in a doc?  maybe useful

programmatically:
- upload
- read
- update
- maintain a repository of documents
- just store it in the "bucket(s)"
